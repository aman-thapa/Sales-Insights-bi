# Project Description
In this project I’ve simulated a business problem resolution to a hardware company.

## About Company
- supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many clients across India
- has a head office in Dehli and regional offices throughout India.

## Business Issue
The sales director is facing a lot of challenges such as:
The marketing is growing dynamically and then he’s struggling in terms of tracking the sales, needing more accurate insights about the company sales, and then take the necessary decisions.

***Imagine the scenario:*** <br/>
The sales director need to know how the sales are going in all operations and the information provided by the regional sales managers are not being enough.
Just hearing the numbers or receive tons of excel files is far from being effective in terms of having a reliable overview of the business.
Instead, he want to be able to look at the data and understand what’s going on right away.

## Solution
Create a simple and informative dashboard about the company sales.

I used SQL queries in **MySQL Workbench** to take a look into the data and **Power BI** for ETL and visualizations to create the insights.<br/>

The dashboard shows all the main information about the company sales, such as Revenue, Sales Quantity, Revenue and Sales by Market, Revenue Trend, Top 5 Customers and Top 5 Products.
It can be filtered by YEAR and MONTH inside the observation period, so the sales director can have a deeper and quick view of the sales to support his decision making process.
